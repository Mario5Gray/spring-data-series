# Scripts dir.

Just a bunch of topic state management scripts... these will be replaced by application startup/other lifecycle actions.
*Update* The deployment scripts have largely ben migrated to a docker compose file.  However, the data sending scripts are still needed ot get data into the app. We can fix this by feeding via Web interface.
